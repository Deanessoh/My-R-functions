In the file "Deans R Functions" you will find 3 functions. Here I provide a brief documentation.

Function 1: Remind_me
I wrote this function to remember the birthdays of my family members.
It takes no arguments and provides 2 outputs:
1. The string "Family birthdays"
2.  A string vector that shows the birthdays of five family members.

Function 2: Cheat
I wrote this function to cheat on exams.
It takes one argument, the number of the exercise you want to cheat on. This should be provideed
as a string. These are the possible inputs: "Q_3_1_2", "Q_3_1_3", "Q_3_1_7"
The function then runs the code needed to generate the answers to these exercises.
The final output is one of 3 plots, depending on the input given to the function.

Function 3: Make_art
i wrote this function to generate pieces of art.
First, I googled ways to generate art in R and found a nice piece of code that generates art.
I then adapted this code and made it into a function. The function takes a random seed as an argument.
The random seed is an integer and running the function generates a piece of art. For instance, you can run the
function like this: Make_art(100). Changing the seed will change the output.
